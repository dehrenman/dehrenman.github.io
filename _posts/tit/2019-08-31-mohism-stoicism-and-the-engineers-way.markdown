In this article, I'll try to introduce you to my patron saint of sorts, a legendary Ancient Chinese engineer, political philosopher, altruist, and stoic-ish character.

Legendary, because all we have left of him is stories, myths, and legends. We're not even sure if Mo Zi is actually the kind of guy legend says he is, or if he's just a filing cabinet, into which people dump made-up stories that looked like they might fit onto him. Stories that capture what they value and what they want in life.

Stoic-ish, because to say he's a stoic would make less sense than to say all stoics are Mohists -- he preceeds Zeno of Citium, founder of the Stoic school of philosophy.

But before I tell you of my fascination with this character, I'm going to go all academic and im-personal and tell you a bit about the time and place where Mo Zi existed.

## The Warring States

Before the first emperor of China[^qinchina], the Eastern lands we now call China is covered by an array of warring states.

[^qinchina]: fun fact: the first imperial dynasty is the Qin dynasty, and it is the namesake for the word China ([etymology of "China"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/china)). So in a sense, this was before China.

It was before the Roman Empire. Before Aristotle. After the Greek philosophers whose wonky ideas were probably not that wonky at the time (think Thales shouting "I understand now! Everything is water. WAAAATER!"). Around the time of Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. Before Zeno of Citium, the first Stoic.

The warring states of China can be likened to the city-states of Greece, with each state harboring its own values, principles, laws, and interests.

The conflict lead to a need for great diversity and innovation in social, political, and engineering thought [^needforthought]. Thinkers traveled among the states, on missions sometimes personal, sometimes assigned by the soverigns they serve. Sometimes expelled or even killed for their ideas, sometimes gaining great power, status, and riches because of them.

At this time there were the "Hundred Schools of Thought", schools of philosophy that consists of great thinkers of their students. While remembered mostly for their political philosophy, these schools dabble in natural philosophy, and even religion. In a sense, some of these schools have attributes like the Pythagorean cult [^pythagoreancult], which ties together natural philosophy, ethics, and fashion styles into a religion of sorts.

## Mo Zi

Of the great and not-so-great teachers leading the hundred schools, one in particular interests me. Engineer, philosopher, altruist, and somewhat of a stoic-ish character, the legacy of Mo Zi represents some of the values I try to have in my life.

Here's a list of some of the things he represents -- or more like, I attribute to him, which I found in the stories about him:

- humble origins
- engineering skill (problem finding, problem-solving)
- stoicism
- community
- science
- altruistic love
- self cultivation
- agnostic but respectful of the role of religion in community-building
- fuck fate. My destiny is mine and I'll struggle till the end.
- soul-in-the-game
- preparation for the worst case
- merit > age, logic > authority
- respect

Stories I want to tell:

- MoZi vs Lu Ban, especially where the part he prepares for his own execution and where he stands in the rain
- how mohist thought ran out of popularity and got superceded by Confucian thought because Confucian thought was moulded towards imperial interests
- the horse gets whipped
- commitment even when things suck. Soul in the game.
- no attack. always defensive.
- respect opponents.
