# Mozi and Luban

Note: Mo Zi roughly translates into "Mo the Rabbi / Mo the Teacher", but his actual name is Mo-Di, where Mo is the family name, meaning "Ink", and Di is the given name, meaning "Great Hawk".

In a previous half-finished post, I made an outline of how I'm infatuated with this ancient Chinese philosopher/politician/rabbi/engineer character called MoZi. In this post, I'd like to tell one of his storeis I like a lot. It's about one clever pacifist risking his life to save his home state from a menacing neighbor.

## The Story

Mo Di lived in the nation of Song. The neighboring state, Chu, has been growing in power and influence ever since the king of Chu acquired the services of Lu Ban, a carpenter still worshiped around China even now as a minor god and a guardian saint of sorts. Lu Ban developed numerous weapons of siege and naval war for Chu, and helped the King of Chu acquire massive tracts of land from its other neighbor, Yue.

Mo Di learned about Chu's growing influence, and feared for the security of his state. He could advised the King of Song to construct defences, or used his engineering expertise to prepare countermeasures, but his first response was to walk ten days and nights to the land of Chu. The skin on his feet boiled and burst with stress, strain, and abrasion, but he merely tore off pieces of his clothes to bandaged it and carried on.

When he arrived, he went to visit Lu Ban. The two had some mutual respect, but Mo Di had always disagreed with how Lu Ban used his expertise for weaponary, since Mo Di was a pacifist and always focused on building productive equipment.

After the niceties, Mo Di asked Lu Ban, "Could you kill somebody for me? There's this man from the north who insulted me". Lu Ban was flustered and somewhat angry, probably like how you would be if I suddenly showed up at your place and asked you to kill somebody for me. After Lu Ban said no, Mo Di said, "But I'll pay you! Would a thousand units of gold get you to do the job?", and Lu Ban answeredthat he wouldn't do it for any amount of gold, because he felt it's wrong to kill without a just cause.

Mo Di immediately latched onto this statement. After doing a few Kow-tows to apologize for what he said and what he's about to say, Mo Di told Lu Ban that he thinks that Lu Ban is contributing to a massacre without a cause by building siege equipment for the Chu conquest of Song. On top of this, Mo Di also reasoned that that by launching a campaign against Song, Chu is trading a scarce resource for an abundant one, where the scarece resource is labor and the lives of men, and the abundant one is land, of which Chu has plenty from the conquest of Yue.

Lu Ban is shaken, but he refused to do anything to alter the course of the Chu campaign. Despite feeling bad from Mo Di's moralizing, he has much to lose and little to gain from speaking up against the campaign. By speaking up or refusing to carry on, he risks his career at Chu and his reputation as a siege engineer. His loyalty to Chu binds him, and his self-interest hinders him. So he said, "Well, I already told the King of Chu that I'll serve on this campaign. I can't quit now."

So Mo Di asked Lu Ban to introduce him to the King.

Different meeting, same strategy. Again, Mo Di started the conversation with a parable and a question: "I saw, oh king, a man rich with chariots and silk, rice, vegetables, and meat. Yet instead of enjoying what he has, he covets his neighbor's shabby wheelbarrow and shabby blanket. And he stole his neighbor's sac of grits. What do you think of this man?"

And the king replied, "That seems to be a man of a very sick mind. Some sort of kleptomania perhaps."

Mo Di again repeated his apologetic routine, and then listed all that is good about the land of Chu, and compared it to the lack of food, fish, usable wood, and diverse species in Song. But the king of Chu cares little about his moralizing, and said, "But Lu Ban already built some siege weapons for me".

So Mo turned to Lu and asked him to play-siege him, using wood chips as soldiers and siege weapons, and a silk belt as the castle wall of Song. Lu Ban devised 9 different plans with 9 sets of different weapons, all defeated by Mo Di with inventions of his own. At the end of 9 turns, Lu has exhausted his strategies. However, though flustered, Lu still said, "I'm flustered, but I will stil win if we sieged Song. My last strategy is good, but I cannot bear to say it."

Mo Di agreed: "You do have one last strategy, but I wouldn't say it out loud either."

And the King of Chu got curious. Before he could force the last strategy out of Lu Ban, Mo Di spoke up. He said, "The last strategy is simple. Lu can simply ask you to execute me here and now, and all would have been lost for Song. But he is a kind man, and couldn't bear to do so."

But before the King could react, he quickly added, "But for that too I have prepared countermeasures. I have 300 desciples in Song, sharing my expertise and ready to defend the city. If you have me murdered, Song's defences will run just as if I were there to orchestrate them. I apologise for having put the two of you through my ruses, and I earnestly hope that you don't taint your hands by killing me out of spite."

At this point, I imagine Lu Ban letting out a deep breath of relief, for now that Mo Di brings his last strategy into daylight, his conflict between righteousness and loyalty is resolved, and he gets to keep both his career and his reputation.

I'm not sure what the King thought about Mo Di, but Mo was allowed to return to the land of Song. Nobody knew what he had one, and the guards wouldn't let him in. So he camped for three days and three nights in the rain, outside the city that he had saved.

## What I liked about what Mo Di did

As sort of a backdrop for what I'm about to say, I want to point out that Mo is an engineer, and a good one when it comes to defence and productive equipment. I feel a kind of closeness for this, but I don't quite admire this part. Don't get me wrong - - I do admire talent and effort and understanding of applied physics. But that just proves tha Mo has a sound mind and thinks about his own future.

What really felt special to me was how considerate and compassionate he is, at great cost to himself. He raced to Chu on foot when he could have taken his belongings and everyone important to him and moved elsewhere. He is a pacifist, and he seems to care a lot about human lives. To realize this universal care and respect for life, he put himself into the extremely awkward and dangerous situation between Lu Ban and the King, risking his life. And when he talked the king and the carpenter into not waging war, it was clear that he didn't exclude the two aggressors from his care either - - he reasoned in terms of their best interest, and set up the situation such that choosing peace over war not only makes them feel like good people but also serves their other interests.

And from the story I don't see him complaining about his foot or his nights outside the city. I see a proud old man telling his students about what he did. And I see him ending every story telling session with "and it's worth it".

The kind of risks he take, the kind of rewards he seek (benefits for others, rewards of principle) all convince me that he's an admirable person, and a brave one too. Reminds me of N.N. Taleb's concept of skin-in-the-game, and soul in the game. Mo took a huge gamble, and his rewards are mostly moral and on a pricipal level, paid out in benefits to others, including the King and the carpenter. Especially when he set it up so that the duo were forced to have skin in the game and prevented from shirking responsibility for the siege. That's a really cool thing that he did.

an outline i did during the writing of this post:





- Social engineering, drawing the best out of people
    - Knowing people's weaknesses, but instead of poking them in their weak spots, take care of their interests and feelings to accomplish one's goals.
- Engineering for good
- Risking one's life for one's tasks and goals
- Wading into awkward areas because it's worth it
