# Premovision

A little ways off I saw a figure. Taking a moment, I peered at the features, forgetting politeness. The heavy mist should have hindered my eyes, already weak, but strangely, this figure seemed to fit the haze. Of course! It was Willow. Somehow she was here, in the same place I wandered into so wildly, and here she was, in a different outfit than earlier today, no less. Now, bark almost blue and leaves so softly green they neared lavender wove together and faded seamlessly into the fog. I saw her so clearly, nearly head-on, but I couldn't at all tell if she saw me. It seemed like she was distantly conscious of me but her awareness was not concentrated on me, or anything else for that matter. She didn't look like she was daydreaming, but I could not tell whether she had any focus at all.

Moving towards Willow, I waited to call out. I didn't really want to address her at all; I was the one out of place. Still, I couldn't simply move on in this otherworld without speaking to the only person here. Picking my way through the waterways I found fewer and fewer dry stepping-places. All my initial reluctance to get my feet wet melted away, maybe due to an embrace of my surroundings, or maybe the water simply felt right. Unlike most beds these allowed strong steps, not slippery, unsure ones, and each footfall i almost longed to join the trees and allow roots to sprout, drink deep, and spread. 

I came to the first set of waterfalls I needed to cross. 

"You have good vision," a deep voice spike. Not quite startled, I looked around for the speaker. Not five yards away stood a grand stone, flat-topped and roundly smooth while still natural and rough. As it rose between two-foot waterfalls, the stone looked like a roofless pillar or an altar. It seemed too full of soul, though, to seat a sacrifice or a Simon Stylites. Willow still did not quite face us. 

"Thank you, but I'm actually pretty short-sighted." 

"It is so. But perception is in the mind as well as the eyes, and I see possibility in yours." The voice was full, speaking with earned authority. I couldn't mistake the stone's voice for anything human; all the technical qualities like pitch, intonation, and the rest were different; but it was the soul, telling so much more than I have the knowledge to understand. 

"It's hard to imagine the possibility of a talking stone," I laughed, half self-conscious and half self-mocking. 

"Yet you've already accepted that it is so, even as you look for how and why. Listen now. I compliment your vision for how you see the mist, not me."

"Thank you but I'm still confused. I don't have to try with the mist, since it's more familiar and expected."

"Yes, and you are one of the few. You see, most people look through fog when they might spend minutes or more watching the same cloud a hundred feet higher. When the cloud embraced you, you accepted it, and when you see mist, you see it for a thing itself rather than just a visual obstruction. In such a light is it any wonder a stone should have self enough to speak?" 

"Sorry, I'm still thinking. I talk to myself pretty often, and I know humans easily attribute their perception to an inherent characteristic of what they see. Isn't it possible I'm projecting, or hallucinating? It wouldn't be the first time, you know." 

"Your questions are good. Let me tell you something you do not know, but first I offer you wisdom. Will you take it?" Down my body flooded—flash!—a new waterway as the body suddenly knew of its weakness. 

"Please," was all I said. 

"To begin with: see as you see the fog and the stone. Leaving things their respect is not a weakness and does not stop all conflict. In doing this you will avoid enemies you do not expect as well as those you recognize. You will be a source of power. That power others will use as they see fit, for all purposes, with all consequences."

"Doesn't that make me responsible?"

"You like yet fear to think so, but no, you may be empowering without having power over someone."

"I think I understand. Can I give a bad example?"

"By all means," the stone said, and water spurted just a little higher off the rock. 

"You can encourage me by talking and listening, but you can't physically or verbally make me do anything." 

"A better example than you think. When was the last time you touched someone?" 

"I didn't think a magic stone would ask about my sex life," I couldn't help laughing. 

"Your sex life couldn't make you feel less alone." I kept laughing, but the hurt was openly part of it now. 

"Manipulation and abuse make do with less." 

"Come now, I know your fears. I know you've hurt others, and failed them. They have done the same to you. Let me speak more directly; if we are to make use of this conversation I must deal with your deflections. You don't really need the advise I've given so far. After all, this is how you live: keep far enough away, partly in an attempt to do what I have said, and partly in simple pain and fear. You will have a legacy. You cannot help the inevitable effect of your existence, in presence or in absence."

"I know..." I nodded, shaking from an inner cold. 

"You cannot judge your effect. Stop striving, reach the other side of silence, and you will find what you seek, from creativity to intimacy. Though you will rarely know it the truth will meet you everywhere. So, do not be afraid wherever you find yourself."

I choked on tears. "Why can't I say anything?" 

"Why can I speak, though I am a stone?" Despite myself I laughed, and the laugh was real. The stone went on. 

"You have a good voice as well as vision. Silence takes many forms, you know, and it can go where speech cannot be formed, uttered, or heard. Around your soul is the chasm of individuality. Speech and silence, and the minds of others build great bridges. Remember the chasm is to be crossed, and not to be crossed."

"I understand."

"Whenever you catch yourself splitting apart, say this: this also is your life."

"This also is my life," I repeated. 

"And you will receive the gift

the gift of death."

"When?" Already broken, I had no anger. 

"Days from now. Do not worry which, it will not be long but your time will be sufficient."

"How quick will it work?"

"Your wish will come true. You will not feel pain."

"How will you give it?"

"Death is not my gift to give. But Willow will carry it to you in her hands."

"Thank you." I was grateful, and content. Life seemed no less full, and my fear dwindled to an ember alone. In response to my thanks, the stone fell silent and I listened to the waterfall as I wiped my tears.
