# Skaldrun Meets the Faery

Heaven beat the Earth with blinding bolts of lightning, each accompanied by a thunderous rebuke. Some grumbled at Earth’s disobedience, some threatened punishment with louder cracks, and some made deafening good on the promise, rending sky and scorching land. One such lightning lash roused steam and snow from the peak. With a groan, flakes and sheets and chunks shook free of the mountain’s aged face. Cascades fell to expose stony features and stubbled firs. The avalanche crushed or carried off great stones once hid under layers of gaudy green and torrid soil. While solid rock spoke of an indomitable heart and enduring face, Heaven’s electrifying blow wrought such damage that Skaldrun realized the helplessness of Earth.

A nearer bolt startled the dragon and drove her, scrambling, for cover she could not trust. Even mighty Mount Nadat shivered involuntarily before the wrath of clouded Heaven. Without the means to contend above, the Earth shook and steamed as the mount swept chaotic devastation over its own surface. Elemental fury quivered and cracked the trees, driving all mobile creatures underground. Though long unfeeling, individual stones cried out or whistled through nature’s most piercing organ.

Skaldrun dug through snow down to soil and below, desperate to escape the primary battleground. The scream of the dragon driven wild simply vaporized, smothered by the overpowering pandemonium.

Gaining some coherence, the dragon hero pled: 
“Dear Mount Nadat, hear me! Feel my thrumming heart and throat, for I call to you from your flesh, and as your kin. Please, become again my guide and guardian. Return to us, spirit of Nadat, and maybe Heaven too will see your kindness and show the same to you. Please!” Skaldrun shrieked as the mountain shifted again angrily. “Nalondhan please…” Heaven and Earth’s thunder pounded out of the dragon’s head all the speeches readied for the vaunted spirit.

Ringing waves of vibration crashed over Skaldrun and shook her in the chaos of the battle-rhythm. While the dragon lay safely in the chambers of the Earth, even those rooms crashed with the force of the conflict outside. Unheroic, the mobile messenger crouched and whimpered, helpless.

Tremors chilled Skaldrun while her ears continued throbbing. She dared at last to step towards the surface. Stunned and incapable of realizing  that  the storm had passed, the dragon emerged. Skaldrun stumbled into blinding light, depriving her of sight as well as hearing. She turned again, exhausted and injured by mere proximity to the thunderous battle, and collapsed to rest in the dragons’ beloved Earth.

Keenly tuned ears and feet confirmed at last the racing heartbeat of the mountain. Skaldrun recognized the agitation, unwinding  slowly in the wake of such a monumental struggle. Resolve crept higher and higher as if the hero were building a dragon mound. ‘But like those sacred hills, the center is empty,’ Skaldrun thought to herself. ‘Then again, is not the heart of the mountain the same? For without space beneath our flesh, where could the spirit dwell?’

“Nalondhan, spirit of mount Nadat, I come.” The gritty voice grasped determination in clenched dragon teeth. “Though small in the Dragonhome, nothing in the great halls of spirits, I have the birthright of dragons. I stand before you with the earthen flame kindling my heart. I come boldly because you, Nalondhan the Simmering, are my kin. You are great among spirits and I am small among dragons, but we both come from the earthen Mother’s womb.” As the speech wore on, the weariness of recitation, journey, and storm weakened the expression of such noble sentiments.

Gathering herself, Skaldrun again crawled out of her storm shelter, a small and pitiful scrape in the proud mountain slope. Blinding white reflected off the snow that smothered the forest with elemental carnage. “In Earth’s name,” the dragon gasped. She gazed long towards her home, hidden below the earth, below the trees, below the horizon. Gashes clearly visible from above scored the forest to mark the battleground. Skaldrun paused as she tried to remember a ritual to honor fallen trees. “May you rest in the Earth’s embrace, enrich the soil, and find new life there,” she improvised.

The dragon hero felt her courage falter, knowing Nadat’s role in the devastation below. She turned around to glare up at the mountain, ensuring the face beheld her accusation. The towering face appeared elongated from below, impressing the dragon with its disdain. Once sure her point was made, she grew insecure remembering the power she reproached. Skaldrun began searching for wherever the mountain’s mouth might be. She must reach the heart.

Heights did not especially appeal to dragons born of Earth and bound to her. Yet the glory of mountain caves seemed to beckon Skaldrun. She remembered her childhood sketches of the mountain home she’d one day carve. Backward glimpses of her home and youth brought stories of other dragons to mind. Many accidental heroines and heroes met some noble or mischievous spirit in great carven halls. Following their example, this dragon hero ventured toward her own encounter.

Upon the slope, other creatures began appearing. The dragon perceived them mostly in flashes of motion and color. Some, though, like that distant squirrel, paused long enough for Skaldrun to truly see it. The animal’s fast-twitch fear stirred the dragon’s inner fire. Waking during the snow season must explain the exhaustion apparent in the drooping tail and stooping stance. “I speak for more than myself. I speak for more than my home,” the messenger muttered, burning.

The lizard shape of Skaldrun began to scramble and scale the face of mighty Mount Nadat. Perhaps distracted by her strange surroundings, or interminable recitations, the dragon failed to attend to one strong pulse. Layers of snow crunched, then exploded. Skaldrun felt a great weight shove her aside. Bristling fur crackled as it brushed and scraped shimmering scales. Skaldrun grunted sharply as a few ripped off. Side to side her body snapped, moving backward to gain space. Once twice her length separated them, she crouched in apology and dipped her head. The bear charged her while she bowed. Something deep in Skaldrun twisted while the ursine pounce crushed her surprise, pity, and disappointment.

Twisting at the neck, the dragon opened her mouth, scraping teeth through her attacker’s coat and into his hide. The bear squirmed in pain, which enabled Skaldrun to follow up with a heavy foreclaw blow. Pressure lifted from the raw, bleeding flesh exposed by the torn scales and both combatants withdrew again.

Skaldrun lashed her tongue out in warning and dipped her head a second time to give her fellow creature an undeserved honor. “For Nadat’s sake and Earth’s, I grant this. May it save you.” She declared in a deliberately loud voice. The bear’s clouded eyes stared at her, its gaze following the dragon as Skaldrun made a wide circle and continued on her way.

The wounded messenger emerged from a band of trees onto the brink of a gully. Scattered about it lay boulders and stumps, looking as if the mountain had chewed them, then spit them out. Above the rising ravine, Nadat’s great mouth gaped. 

“Nalondhan, where have you gone? Or what has become of you, to turn your face? The sun may be of Heaven, but such defiance pains this place. Are you departed from your dear Nadat, leaving it empty? Yet I have seen your conflict with the skies. I know some spirit still dwells here. Could it be you’re vanquished, or usurped, by some fractured speck of Night?”

Skaldrun scraped her way up to the mouth of the cave. A searing smell hit the dragon’s nostrils, turning what ought to be a mighty, honored hall into a sickening, desecrated hole. Out of the gray abyss belched suffocating clouds of steam. The dragon turned and paused a moment, taking in the air and view before she turned again to confront the spirit of the mountain. Through the poisonous exhalations, through the corrupting inhalations, the hero ventured and resorted to memories of earthen tunnels and clarifying heartbeats. The heart of fire drew the dragon like oxygen, carrying her by swirling currents toward the bloody center.

The mists grew heavier and echoes louder as Skaldrun pierced the hard-bound chambers of mighty Mount Nadat. Always toward the beating heart she moved, clinging to ledges and crouching beneath ceilings lower than her upraised neck. Stronger and multiplied the heartbeat sounded, amplified by proximity and ambient reflection. Such a cacophony pounded Skaldrun’s ears that she thought she glimpsed the pulsing organ in the vague, illusory strands of vapor.

Another sharp turn struck the dragon hero with a blast of heat and she stood beyond the edge of mist, the waves and foam outstretched from a lapping magma lake before her feet.

Skaldrun gasped, and heat flooded her lungs. It felt as if molten flame transmuted the vital blood that coursed through her. Straining, the dragon looked up to see the throne. The prismed crystal seat, heart of Nadat, bent its radiating colors in sharp angles toward the seated spirit. Murky shadow held the center and spread to form the inner silhouette of a bipedal figure. Outlined edges smoked with shadowed flares and an aura of hues magnetically drawn for the form’s consumption. The living spirit, barely incarnated in its flaming form, exuded the power of another world.

“Nalondhan, mighty fay of Mount Nadat, I come as your Earthly kin. I speak—”

“You speak before me, tunnel-crawler.”

“Yes, spirit Simmerer. Though low among my kind—”

“You stand small in the Dragonhome.”

“As small there as you stand towards the Heavens. But I speak to you since your land suffers. Reverence for you, Nalondhan, and your seat Nadat wane swifter than the phases of the Moon. The dragons sent me to seek whether you might even remain here. Nadat quakes and steams, and your creatures go mad with rage or fear.”

“You shiver with anger at me.”

“I do, great spirit! I never claim to understand you or your kind, but to sit and speak so, you abandon your duty and your nature as well as mine.”

“You judge me.”

“That I do not dare, revered one. I seek to honor you, I with my fellow children of Earth. But you seem to scorn me for it.”

“You shall judge me, dragon.” The monotone issued from a waving ripple of formless shadow while the voice cracked like licks of fire. With a twisted motion, more like smoke than a body, the spirit stood. “You appeal to kinship, duty, and nature. All mine are fire, flame, and inferno. You bear witness to the drought before rain, and I will rain from this Mount such a wealth that you and your kind will know no want. In this chamber, I have wrested the glowing treasure of Nadat.” Skaldrun’s eyes bulged as she looked at the pools of lava — and she shivered, oblivious to the overwhelming heat.

“See the gift I have prepared!” The voice sounded, “See the flame, birthright of dragons. See the earth, mother spirit of the dragons. Judge me, dragon, for my generosity.”
Steam and smoke choked Skaldrun’s cry as she leapt towards the horrible figure. The inborn fire blazed in Skaldrun’s eyes, a brighter spark than all the glowing chamber. Winding then lashing, the dragon snapped at the murky spirit. Her mouth flooded with even greater heat and fumes. She barely kept hold while the enemy seemed to smoke away. It gripped Skaldrun’s scales with searing heat before it tore flesh and scales alike.

The dragon slashed repeatedly at the spirit’s legs. Reaching higher, she dug her claws into its torso and pulled the form down to the ground. The spirit thrust a vaguely outlined arm into Skaldrun’s face. While the bulk missed her eye, it smote a terrible, corruptive wound above her visioned orb and destroyed one ear. Pulling upward, the dragon seized her foe’s arm and clamped her jaws down harder.

Unearthly sounded the spirit’s screech as Skaldrun neared the consumptive heart while she thrashed to pin down her enemy. Sucking in oxygen constantly, the breathless scream dragged on and on with ever rising pitch. The molten flesh of the mountain rose before rushing toward the shadowed fay. Instead of using its other arm to strike immediately, the limb reached out and thrust its hand to meld with the lava.

Strength and form pumped into the increasingly corporeal spirit. Skaldrun sensed her foe’s growth. The dragon loosed her fanged grip just enough to move without breaking through the spirit’s body and thereby losing it. Groaning, crying in tune with the aching mountain, she began to shuffle and drag herself along, still carrying her enemy, away from throne and chamber. The fay kept hold of a rivulet of magma that progressively thinned to a trickle before snapping as Skaldrun moved further and further away.

The clouded passageways darkened, somehow, as Skaldrun separated spirit and fire. Exhaustion and exertion slowed the hero’s progress, each step another struggle against her enemy’s power and her own repulsion. Time and time again her enemy nearly cast her into some deeper chasm, but each time the hero held her ground.

At last she broke out of the fumes and caves onto the majestic balcony of Nadat’s lower lip. The spirit began to gasp strangely and writhe more furiously, though less controlled, so Skaldrun took her chance. Momentarily releasing her hold entirely, the dragon hero snapped down on the vaguely outlined head and heart. Whatever force gave those shadowed limbs their vital motion, it dissipated and the body exploded into smoke and ash. In her mouth, the fullness of heat and hatred concentrated into a single coal. The horror overwhelmed Skaldrun and she retched. Instead of spitting out the miniaturized spirit, the blazing ember slipped down her throat.

If the ordeal drained and diminished the dragon before, now it drove her wild. Unnatural flexibility contorted Skaldrun’s body as conflict consumed her from within; all thought perished in the devouring flame. Horrible cries and devastation swept down the mountainside before, behind, and all around the dragon in her throes. The waste from Skaldrun’s second battle scorched a thrashing path through the forest. Fragments of prayers escaped in frantic, disconnected syllables as the dragon dashed towards the river. Each breath threatened to relinquish and release the captive fay.

Half-breaths cut off once Skaldrun plunged into the shallows. From inside, the beating on intestines weakened and she heard a pathetic squeal. Then instinctive and spiteful defense awakened. The spirit put forth its power and emptied all its stores of earthly fire, lava scorching Skaldrun as the two together vomited. Spewing, spitting, it cooled the instant it struck the air and water. Superheated rock regained its frozen form and began to coalesce about the dragon.

A floating, then sinking stone sprouted and stood in the center of the river. Vestiges of fluidity rooted the island in the river’s welcoming bed. The massive form vaguely resembled the shape of the dragon it enclosed. Though the spirit lived, it lived in motionless confinement maintained by the rushing water and imprisoning rock. 

In the midst of it all, the dragon thought, “This way the spirit may expire in time, or at least be held harmless as long as Earth remains.” So comforted, Skaldrun sighed and breathed no more.
