Imagine you're a small spacecraft. You don't have a mission and don't have a goal, unless you decide on one for yourself.

You have an immeasurable amout of fuel, and capable of travelling at extremely fast speeds, but never exceeding that of light.

And you're in a universe whose fabric is expanding at, say, x% per year, meaning that things that were a kilometer away this year is going to be (1+x%) kilometers away next year, not because they moved, but because the space underneath them has stretched.

You made a mistake, approached a black hole, got shredded by the objects orbiting it, and barely made your way out of its well of gravity.

Now you face a choice.

Do you keep approaching things, and risk being shredded by unseen satellites and sucked in by massive black holes?

Or do you stay away for the rest of time, away from any object of significant mass? If you do find an empty zone of space, go to the center of it, and stay there, you will never risk collision again.

But as the fabric of space expands, like an ant on an infinitely expanding balloon, you will be torn away from everything around you. And since the more space you have between two points the faster space grows (that's what x%/year expansion means, after all), eventually you will be so far from everything that you're out of their light cones. And what that means is, after a long, long time like this you will be separated from everything by a vast, dark, cold, and expanding void that leaves no hope of ever reaching anything again.

And then you will be truely alone.

And that's why I think it's better to approach than to leave. Even if you risk dying in a black hole.
