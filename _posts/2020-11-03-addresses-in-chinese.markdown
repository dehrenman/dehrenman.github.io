*This is an edited excerpt of my chat logs with my friend Rainflower. I figured it might be an interesting read so I post it here.*

It's kindda funny how addressing people in Chinese works.

Since the language got so much history and such a large average speaker population over that long history.

## 1. 小姐
For example, 小姐 used to mean "daughter of rich family". Originally "little big sister", as in "you might be younger than me but I offer you older person level respect"

And then everyone was calling each other "小姐".

And then for some reason now it only refers to prostitutes.



## 2. 同志

Literally, "同志" means "same will / same long term goal". Before communist China, peope in political movements together used it to refer to their peers.

Then it meant "comrade" and was used a lot by the commies. I guess that's not that big of a shift ... or even a shift at all. It's just that the major political movement was the communist one, so when you said "comrade" it's reaonsable to assume that you're refering to your fellow communists.

But now it means homosexual. So that's something. [^homosexualsubversion]

[^homosexualsubversion]: There's something subversive about this. I vaguely remember this having something to do with avoiding censorship or whatnot. So that's interesting.




## 3. 姑娘

literally it means "auntie".

But now it means "girl". As in, "I'mma talk about you as if you're an old woman but we both know you're not old at all so it emphasizes that you're young".


Thanks for coming to my lecture on the etymological history of common Chinese addresses. I go back to work now.

Lmk which of these you know beforehand and whether any of them was surprising to you. Cause they were all pretty darn surprising to me when I first learned em. infraredhammerhead@gmail.com


## Notes
All of the above comes from my sense of how things work as a native Chinese speaker. I don't have any sources for the above. If there are inaccuracies, or sources I should be citing, do me a favor and email them to infraredhammerhead@gmail.com
